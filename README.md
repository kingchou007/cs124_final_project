# Smart-Security-Camera by Raspberry Pi

We are trying to do a security home camera. The system can monitor the target area 24/7, and get the weather data from websites through python and use LEDs to display system status. This is a real-time internet-connected camera. It can show the weather information of the target region.

The other thing that we focus on is light, and we want to create different lights by changing the status of the system power. The red LED represents the system is on and the camera is monitoring a certain area.

The camera can capture any dynamic object that is moving, and take the real-time photo(s) then upload to the Dropbox (a cloud Drive) for the owner to check the details whenever and wherever he/she wants.

This project contains three main components: a motherboard & power supply, a LED, and a camera.

1) Motherboard & power supply: the mainboard of this electronic thermometer is Raspberry Pi that controls all the power and control systems. It contains the portals that need to be used by other components.

2) Red LED: this component shows the status of the system power.

3) Camera: this component is to monitor rooms in real-time.
